I'm a curious and fast-learning junior software developer with a strong background in chemistry. I am eager to join a team with a supportive environment to develop my skills further and use my excellent problem-solving skills to contribute to real-world projects. I have experience with working in teams and independently. In the past four months, I have explored PL/SQL, Java and testing. I'm currently undertaking the Java 17 Masterclass course on Udemy. Next, I plan to obtain the OCA certification.
